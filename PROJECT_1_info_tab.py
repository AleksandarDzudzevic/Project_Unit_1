    print(f"""{bold_cyan}Crypto choice
Like previously mentioned, Ms.Sato is open to explore crypto currency of developers choice, and we at InveSOL chose SOLANA.

{purple_bold}Solana{end_code}
Solana is a blockchain platform designed to host decentralized, scalable applications. Solana can process many more transactions per second and charges lower transaction fees than rival blockchains like Ethereum.

{purple_bold}Why SOLANA{end_code}
Very similar to why we chose Python, SOLANA's best qualities allign with what we at InveSOL are trying to achieve.

{purple_bold}FAST{end_code}
Compared to it's competitors, Solana performs it's transactions at much faster speed with amazing 400 millisecond block times. And as hardware gets faster, so does the network.

{purple_bold}CHEAP{end_code}
The avarage transaction fee sits at avarage of only $0.00025 with not a single one being more than 0.01 which makes it a perfect choice for both part-time and full-time crypto investors.

{purple_bold}SECURE{end_code}
With more than 2500 transatcions per second, and more than 100 BILLION successful transations,The Solana network is spread over thousands of independent nodes â€” which means that your transactions are always safe. The safety of your assets is the number ONE priority.
