# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will to design and make a ———— for a client who is ———. The ——– will about ———— and is constructed using the software ———. It will take  ———- to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria ———.

** add a description of your coin and citation **

Justify the tools/structure of your solution

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal). 
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected. 
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger has login and sign up option, allowing privacy of information for each user. The database containing asswords will be HASHED, which is why InveSOL is a perfect choice for you if you value security of your data and crypto.
5. The electronic ledger asks the real time price of the coin and then the electronic ledger shows the porfolio value change by using colored and user friendly method of (%) calculating and displaying the : value of current porfolio|(total amount invested+/- expenses in usd$)  x100% using the price change from the last SOL price input.
6. Tracker of the expenses with the value displayed in ¥ and $ allowing user to choose the currency they prefer, and also in crypto value(using the latest value input of SOL)(Possibly a colored graph as well)
7. The ledger analysis the porfolio change and withdrawal and deposit history, and then gives some of the following suggestions: Warning for spending crypto while its price is one of the lowest ever inputed, or saying that its a good time to exchange it to real money. (basically DCA with a conclusion)
