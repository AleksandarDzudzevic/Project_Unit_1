# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all her transaction using an outdated method of a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. Ms. Sato would also apriciate if the ledger could help her with investing by warning her if the price is unusualy high or low and if she should sell or buy. The ledger is developed in order to help investors like Ms.Sato switch from old to newer and easir ways to track their investments and get acces to different analytics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.


## Proposed Solution

I will design and make a digital and easy to use crypto ledger for a client who is local crypto investor. The digital ledger will be about ———— and is constructed using Python 3.9 on PyCharm platform and it runs on M1 MacBook(2020) base model. The main reason why we chose this model instead of the better one which was available, becuase we at InveSOL believe that everyone should be able to invest easy, fast and safely using our program. It will take around 15-20 hours to make the version 1, after which it will be evaluated according to the criteria stated by the client. 

Why Python? : The reason why we chose Python as the language that we will use for this is simple. It perfectly alligns with our values and main benefits of our program. It is beginner-friendly (one of the reasons why we added the InveSOL analisys so that even the beginners can invest at a high level). It is fast, just like our program which tries to make the execution time as fast as possible(ex. most while loops are replaced by a faster option (for)).
   
 Sky is the limit!!! Just like python which has so many features and cool options, InveSOL.py team aims to make InveSOL app that will constantly develop and get new features which will help more SOLANA investors reach their goals.

## Crypto choice
Like previously mentioned, Ms.Sato is open to explore crypto currency of developers choice, and we at InveSOL chose SOLANA.
 ### Solana 
Solana is a blockchain platform designed to host decentralized, scalable applications. Solana can process many more transactions per second and charges lower transaction fees than rival blockchains like Ethereum.
#### Why SOLANA
Very similar to why we chose Python, SOLANA's best qualities allign with what we at InveSOL are trying to achieve. 
###### FAST
Compared to it's competitors, Solana performs it's transactions at much faster speed with amazing 400 millisecond block times. And as hardware gets faster, so does the network.
###### CHEAP 
The avarage transaction fee sits at avarage of only $0.00025 with not a single one being more than 0.01$ which makes it a perfect choice for both part-time and full-time crypto investors.
###### SECURE
With more than 2500 transatcions per second, and more than 100 BILLION successful transations,The Solana network is spread over thousands of independent nodes — which means that your transactions are always safe. The safety of your assets is the number ONE priority.

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal). 
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected. 
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger has login and sign up option, allowing privacy of information for each user. The database containing asswords will be encrypted, which is why InveSOL is a perfect choice for you if you value security of your data and crypto.
5. The electronic ledger asks the real time price of the coin and then the electronic ledger shows the porfolio value change by using colored and user friendly method of (%) calculating and displaying the : value of current porfolio|(total amount invested(deposits)- expenses in usd$(withdrawls))x100% using the price change from the last SOL price input.
6. The electronic ledger allows user to see their deposit and withdrawal history, allowing them to have all information needed in one place.
7. The ledger analysis the porfolio change and withdrawal and deposit history, and then gives some of the following suggestions: Warning for spending crypto while its price is one of the lowest ever inputed, or saying that its a good time to exchange it to real money. (basically DCA with a conclusion)
8. The ledger will offer basic information about SOL and why we at InveSOL chose it as our crypto.
